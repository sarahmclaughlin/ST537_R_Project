# Classification Method for Analysis of Wine Data Set  
Bring in the data and split into training and testing sets.  
```{r SM wine data}
# Bring in the two data sets 
red.wine <- read.csv("winequality-red.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
white.wine <- read.csv("winequality-white.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

# Create red and white variable  
red.wine$color <- c("red")
white.wine$color <- c("white")

# Combine data into one data set  
wine <- rbind(red.wine, white.wine)
# Make color a factor 
wine$color <- as.factor(wine$color)

# Train and test set 
set.seed(1)
train <- sample(1:nrow(wine), size = nrow(wine)*0.8)
test <- setdiff(1:nrow(wine), train)

wine.train <- wine[train, ]
wine.test <- wine[test, ]
```  

## Linear Discriminant Analysis  
```{r SM LDA}
